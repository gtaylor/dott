Ship Classes
============

There are many different sizes of ships, typically called a *ship class*. While
a ship's class does not limit it to certain roles, the class and size of a ship
strongly influence what said ship can be used for.

A newer player will most likely start with Fighters, working their way up
to whatever ship class feels most comfortable.

.. tip:: Bigger does not always mean better for every situation.

Fighters
--------

Fighters are small, single-pilot ships that require no crew. While some
fighter class ships may be able to carry more than one person, this is the
solo pilot's bread and butter.

Frigates
--------

Frigates are the smallest vessel that is typically manned by a crew, instead
of a single pilot. Frigates are small and simple enough to be easy and
efficient to operate without help or escort.

Cruisers
--------

Cruisers are the next step up from frigates, trading speed and maneuverability
for more defensive and/or offensive capabilities. Cruisers typically benefit
from having others aboard.

Cruisers may have a difficult time fending off Fighters without Fighter or
Frigate support of their own.

Battlecruisers
--------------

Battlecruisers are the size of a Cruiser, but typically carry Battleship
weaponry. This allows for a cheap way to attack larger targets without
having to rely exclusively on the more expensive and cumbersom Battleships.

Battlecruisers tend to be about as durable as a Cruiser. Due to their larger
weapons (meant for larger targets), Battlecruisers may struggle to fend
off Fighters and Frigates effectively.

Battleships
-----------

Battleships are large, lumbering mammoths, often bristling with lots of nasty
weaponry. These ships' sole purpose is to deal out as much pain as possible,
meanwhile absorbing as much retaliation as possible.

Battleships are almost never seen alone, and require the support of smaller
ships. Battleships are particularly ill-equipped to defend themselves from
large groups of Fighters and Frigates.

Capital Ships
-------------

Capital Ships are the largest ships to grace the space lanes. These range in
purpose from mass cargo freighters, to factory ships, to Carriers and
Dreadnaughts.

Capital Ships are typically very specialized, extremely expensive, and reliant
upon fleet support. Capitals may often field and maintain a complement of
Fighters.
