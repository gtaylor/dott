:Info: A space-themed MUD server
:Author: Gregory Taylor

An overview
===========
Dawn of the Titans is a Twisted Python based MUD server that I work on in my
limited free time. Progress is slow and erratic, and this project may or may not
ever evolve into something live.

This codebase draws heavily what I learned while developing Evennia_. If you
are looking at starting a game that doesn't fit my feature set, you're going
to be much better served by developing on Evennia_. DotT is meant for a very
specific purpose (my individual game), and is not a one-size-fits-all
package like Evennia_.

Status
======

DotT is under perpetual unstable development. This is a hobby project, and
there are no guarantees of backwards compatibility at any time.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.6+
* twisted 11.0+
* python-couchdb
